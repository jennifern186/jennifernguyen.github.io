- **Data Science Research & Visualization** - Shark Attack Data Analysis Report

In this data science project, I collected, cleaned, and analyzed shark attack data using R (tidyverse, dplyr). I conducted exploratory data analysis and built statistical estimates using bootstrapping techniques to generate confidence intervals. Through visualizations created with ggplot2, I translated complex data into clear insights about fatality rates, geographic patterns, and demographic trends.

- **Wrap It Up** – Gift recommendation Web App
  
Wrap It Up is an interactive web application that generates personalized gift recommendations based on user quiz responses. I designed and implemented a responsive, user-centered interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The system includes dynamic filtering by price and category, along with a structured JSON dataset to support efficient client-side rendering and state management.
